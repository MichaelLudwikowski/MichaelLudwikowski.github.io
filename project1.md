## Project description

Stores and searches key-value pairs utilizing simple and complext data structures. Creates a map of a students first and last name to an ID. In other words, maps a string to an integer. 

## How to compile and run the program

This program uses WSL to compile and run the code. 

```bash
make clear
make all
```

## UI Design

The code should run without error and should finish on its own (Fig 1). You can also try running the make clean command to reset the program. In the program you should also see the performance statistics to display how using the data structures allows for the program to run swiftly and efficiency while being accurate at the same time. (Fig 2)
