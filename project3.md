## Project description

Goes to the wikipedia page given and gets the first paragraph summary along with related pages and table if there is one. 

## How to compile and run the program

```bash
On Ubuntu or WSL: 
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
pip install requests beutifulsoup pandas

python3 FinalProject3.py
```

## UI Design

The code simply asks the user for the URL of the page wanted and outputs the rest of the page.

## 3. Additional Considerations

The program requires some additional instalations, which can be difficult if you are not on Ubuntu or don't have a machine that can run a WSL environment. Even after, there are some extentions needed to run the parcing code.
